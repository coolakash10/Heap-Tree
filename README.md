# Heap-Tree
This program gives brief info about HEAP Tree.

HEAP : Heap is a special tree based data structure in which tree is a completely binary tree in which left node of two siblings is either larger or smaller than right node.

HEAP Tree is of 2 types
  1. MAX HEAP
  2. MIN HEAP
 
1. MAX HEAP : parent data is larger than child data
2. MIN HEAP : parent data is smaller than child data

This program include
  1. insert in MAX HEAP
  2. insert in MIN HEAP
  3. delete from MAX HEAP
  4. delete from MIN HEAP
  
Binary Heap is typically implemented using Array where :
  1. Root element :  Arr[0]
  2. Parent node  :  Arr[(i-1)/2]
  3. Left node    :  Arr[(2*i)+1]
  3. Right node   :  Arr[(2*i)+2]
